# My First Portfolio

This project is part of my ALX assignment to learn the basics of HTML.

## Project Structure
- **html_basic/**: contains all HTML files for this project.
  - `base_index.html`: the most basic valid HTML file with proper structure.

## Requirements
- Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are allowed.
- No external libraries (no NodeJS, React, Vue, Bootstrap, etc.).
- All code must be valid according to [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- Each file must end with a new line.

## Outcome
By the end of this project, I will be able to:
- Explain what HTML is and how it works.
- Create valid HTML pages.
- Use tags and attributes to structure content.
- Understand how browsers render web pages.
